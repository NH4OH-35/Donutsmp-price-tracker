# Donutsmp-price-tracker
A Python script that updates the price for you

1  Install Python
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows

Download Python 3.x for Windows

Make sure to:
Check the box that says: Add Python to PATH
(This is very important)

After that, open cmd and run:
pip install matplotlib
pip install pyinstaller

If the script is not running, you have not added Python to the path. (If you did not add Python to path, you need to go to settings and uninstall ,Python and run the installer again The add Python to the path should be at the bottom of the installer)

If pip isnâ€™t recognised, use the full Python path:
C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller

Sometimes the script does not close properly, just go to task manager to fully close it
