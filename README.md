# Donutsmp-price-tracker
A Python script that updates the price for you

1  Install Python
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows

Download Python 3.x for Windows

Make sure to:
Check the box that says: Add Python to PATH
(This is very important)

After that open cmd and run:
pip install matplotlib
pip install pyinstaller

If the script is not running that means you did not add python to path. (If you did not add python to path you need to go to setting and uninstall python and run the installer again the add python to path should be on the bottom of the installer)

If pip isnâ€™t recognized, use full Python path:
C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller
